    "description":"The Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família, commonly known as the Sagrada Família, is a large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926). Although incomplete, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2010 was consecrated and proclaimed a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI. It is incorrect to refer to it as a cathedral as it is not the seat of a bishop. Though construction of Sagrada Família had commenced in 1882, Gaudí became involved in 1883, taking over the project and transforming it with his architectural and engineering style—combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms.

    "description":"Parc Guell by Antoni Gaudi. Parc Guelli is a UNESCO Worid Heritage Site and considered one of Gaudi's top works. Parc Guell is a  top attraction and definite must see. It is on Carmel hill and seeing this site means some uphill walking. The original plan for Parc Guell was to build a private and exclusive residential garden city with 60 houses on the grounds. The plan to sell houses on this development failed due to lack of interest, and in 1923 the site was given to the city council and it became the public park we can all marvel at today. Difficult to get to due to uphill walking but worth seeing."
